			'The Board Rules Extension adds a dedicated Rules page to a board. It offers an ACP module from which an unlimited number of rules and rule categories can be created in each language installed on a board. It also supports sending out notifications to all board members notifying them that the rules have been changed, and can require newly registering users read the board rules as part of the terms of agreement for registering on a board.',
			'The Board Rules Extension is a fairly advanced design compared to previous phpBB modifications. Abstract classes implemented through interfaces are used to specify the methods that handle most of the code logic. There is an Entity class for manipulating a single rule and an Operator class for manipulating sets of rules. Controller classes are used to process the front-end of the ACP module and the Rules page itself. It also makes use of phpBB\'s new notification system, nestedsets/trees, and AJAX functionality in the ACP user-interface. There is also extensive PHP unit test coverage of the code to ensure its stability and reliability and prevent regressions. We think testing code is so important, we\'ve made it possible for any extension (on Github) to use phpBB\'s PHPUnit testing framework with Travis Continuous Integration hosted servers; just look through our tests and travis files/folders to see how we did it.',

Users have the option to dismiss the announcement after they have read it.',
			'Board Announcements is an entry-level extension by design. We built this extension using techniques that will be more familiar to MOD developers. Code changes are injected directly from the event listener, and all ACP module logic is contained in its ACP module class. Overall, this extension is a good example that shows how to inject new code, add an ACP module, utilize a controller file to run some functional code in combination with AJAX, and how to use new config_text table in phpBB 3.1.x to store textual data.',

In addition to allowing boards to easily add Google\'s powerful analytics, this extension is an ideal starting example for new extension authors, demonstrating how to effectively add an ACP config option implement that config setting using template events.',

The ACP\'s page editor allows you to create page content using BBCodes or HTML, making it possible to embed media from other sites and create truly unique pages.',
			'This extension provides another opportunity for developers to analyse an object-oriented and abstracted approach to developing an extension for phpBB. Because the Pages extension can create an unlimited number of pages, it is set up to account for dynamic page routes and links. It allows users to choose a number of possible link locations for each page using mutliple template events, and leverages the power of phpBB\'s finder object to allow users to upload their own custom link icons and page template files. As with all our extensions, there is complete test coverage of all code to ensure maximum stability and reliability.',
